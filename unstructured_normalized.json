Developments in Banking Sector\n4.1 Overall condition of Banking Sector\n\uf0b7 The banking system in India, which evolved over\nseveral decades, is well established and has been\nserving the credit and banking needs of the\neconomy. The banking ecosystem is providing\nimpetus to economic growth and development of\nthe country and catering to the specific and varied\nfinancial requirements of different customers and\nborrowers.\n\uf0b7 To identify and address the issue of stress which\nremained hidden in the form of Standard\nRestructured Assets (SRAs) in the banking\nsystem, RBI initiated Asset Quality Review (AQR)\nin 2015 under which, after transparent recognition\nby banks and withdrawal of the special treatment\nof restructured loans, stressed accounts were\nreclassified as NPAs and expected losses on\nstressed loans, not provided for earlier as a result\nof the special treatment, were provided for,\nresulting in higher NPAs which peaked in 2018.\nHigher NPA and necessitated provisioning deeply\nimpacted the financial parameters of banks and\nimpeded their ability to grow and lend to productive\nsectors of the economy.\n\uf0b7 Government's commitment to reforms in the\nfinancial sector was announced at \"Retreat for\nBanks and Financial Institutions\" called \"Gyan\nSangam\" held in 2015. Later in Aug-2015,\nGovernment launched \"Indradhanush\" scheme for\ncomprehensive framework to revamp and improve\nfinancial state of PSBs including capital infusion\nplan over four years, from FY2015-16 to FY2018-\n19.\n\uf0b7 Government implemented a comprehensive 4R's\nstrategy of Recognising NPAs transparently,\nResolution and Recovery, Recapitalising PSBs,\nand Reforms in the financial system to address\nthe challenges faced by PSBs. The measures\ntaken by the Government/RBI, include, inter alia,\nthe following:Department of Financial Services V\n231\n1. Credit discipline:\n\uf0b7 Enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy\nCode\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has\nlaid down a collective mechanism for resolution\nof insolvencies in the country by maintaining a\ndelicate balance for all stakeholders to preserve\nthe economic value of the entities and to complete\nthe process in a time bound manner. It has:\n\uf0a1 Empowered creditors of a Corporate Debtor;\n\uf0a1 Led to behavioural change in the debtor-\ncreditor relationship by shifting the focus from\nthe 'Debtor in Possession' to a 'Creditor in\nControl' regime.\n\uf0b7 Setting up of the Central Repository of\nInformation on Large Credits\nSetting up of the Central Repository of Information\non Large Credits (CRILC) by RBI:\n\uf0a1 To collects, stores and disseminates credit\ndata to lenders; and\n\uf0a1 Banks are required to submit report on weekly\nbasis to CRILC, in case of any default by\nborrowing entities with exposure of ?5 crore\nand above.\n\uf0b7 Systematic checking of high-value accounts\nfor wilful default and fraud.\n2. Recognition and resolution of stress:  To protect\nfinancial institutions in case of default or payment\ndelay by large borrowers, RBI/Government has taken\nmultiple steps which include, inter alia, the following:\n\uf0b7 Principle-based framework has been put in\nplace for early recognition and time-bound\nresolution\nA comprehensive principle-based framework has\nbeen put in place for early recognition and time-\nbound resolution of stress in the borrower\naccounts, manifesting in payment default.\nDelayed resolution is disincentivised under the\nframework as lenders are required to make\nadditional provisioning in case of resolution plans\nare not implemented within specified timeline.\n\uf0b7 Securitisation and Reconstruction of\nFinancial Assets and Enforcement of Security\nInterest Act, 2002\nSecuritisation and Reconstruction of Financial\nAssets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act,\n2002 (SARFAESI Act) has been amended and it\nwas provided for the District Magistrate / Chief\nMetropolitan Magistrate to pass orders for the\npurpose of taking possession of the secured\nassets by lenders within a period of thirty days\nfrom the date of application;\n\uf0b7 The Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act,\n1993\nThe Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act,1993\nhas been amended with the provision for three\nmonths imprisonment in case the borrower does\nnot provide details of property/assets other than\nthose properties/assets specified by the lender\nwhile filing the application to the DRT;\n\uf0b7 Debt Recovery Tribunal\nJurisdiction of Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT s) was\nincreased from `10 lakh to `20 lakh to enable\nthe DRTs to focus on high value cases;\n\uf0b7 Proactively detection of stress\nTo proactively detect stress and reduce slippage\ninto NPAs, following measures have been\nimplemented:\n\uf0a1 Automated Early Warning Systems (EWS)\nin banks;\n\uf0a1 Use of third-party data; and\n\uf0a1 Workflow focussing on time-bound remedial\nactions.\n\uf0b7 Regulatory framework for Asset\nReconstruction Companies\nRegulatory framework for Asset Reconstruction\nCompanies (ARCs) has been amended with an\nobjective of:\n\uf0a1 Strengthening transparency in the ARC\nsector; and\n\uf0a1 Improving corporate governance standards in\nARCs.\n\uf0b7 Better management of the credit risk\nMarket based mechanisms have been\nstrengthened to enable the financial institutions\nto better manage the credit risk on their balance\nsheets through a comprehensive framework for\ntransfer of stressed assets to eligible transferees.\n3. Enhanced Access & Service Excellence (EASE)\nThrough EASE framework, an objective process of\nincremental reforms in sync with the evolving ecosystem\nhas been institutionalizedsss across PSBs. EASE\nReforms Agenda, deeply ingrained in PSBs and a key\npriority for bank leadership, provides a common agenda\naccounting for requirements of all banks and reflects the\nindustry priorities from short- and long-term perspectives.Annual Report 2024-2025\n232\nAreas of continued focus include - Governance, prudential\nlending, risk management, technology and data-driven\nbanking and outcome-centric HR.\n4. Governance in PSBs\nGovernance in PSBs has been strengthened through:\n\uf0b7 arm's length selection of top management through\nFSIB;\n\uf0b7 introduction of non-executive chairmen in\nnationalised banks;\n\uf0b7 widening talent pool and instituting performance-\nbased extensions for MD;\n\uf0b7 instituting appraisal by Boards of top management\nand NODs;\n\uf0b7 widening the pool of eligible WTDs by including\nprivate sector executives for appointment of MD\n& CEO in large PSBs; and\n\uf0b7 recruitment of CXOs viz., Chief Risk Officer, Chief\nCompliance Officer, Chief Economist from the\nmarket.\n5. Consolidation of PSBs\nWith consolidation of banks, the efficacy of the banking\nsector has been enhanced by leveraging economies of\nscale and synergies. The consolidation exercise has\nresulted in marked improvement in the financials and\ngovernance in these banks. Profits of PSBs have reached\nall time high and they continue to expand their reach to\nevery nook and corner of the country. Their capital base\nhas strengthened and their asset quality has improved.\nBanks are now raising capital from the market instead of\ndepending upon the Government for recapitalization.\n6. National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd.\nNational Asset Reconstruction Company Limited\n(NARCL) and Asset Management Company (IDRCL) have\nbeen set up to consolidate and take over the existing\nstressed debt and then manage and resolve the accounts\nby implementation of various resolution strategies including\ndisposing of the assets to Alternate Investment Funds and\nother potential investors for eventual value realization.\nNARCL has enabled transfer of bad debts of the banks\nfrom their balance sheets to the former, and has also\nenabled freeing up human resources from recovery\nfunctions, for productive business development, including\ncredit deployment.\n\uf0b7 Impact of reforms\nAs a result of Government's overarching policy\nresponse to recognition of stress, resolution of\nstressed accounts, recapitalisation and reforms\nin banks, the financial health and robustness of\nbanking sector has improved significantly.\n(a) As per Reserve Bank of India's provisional\ndata:\n(i) Asset quality has improved\nsignificantly with-\no Gross NPA ratio of SCBs declining to\n2.54%, the lowest in 13 years, ( `4.64\nlakh crore) in Sep-24 from 4.28% (`3.23\nlakh crore) in Mar-15 and from a peak of\n11.18% (`10.36 lakh crore) in Mar-18.\n` lakh crore\n\uf0b7 Gross NPA ratio of PSBs declining to\n3.09% (`3.16 lakh crore) in Sep-24 from\n4.97% (`2.79 lakh crore) in Mar-15 and\nfrom a peak of 14.58% (`8.96 lakh crore)\nMar-18.\no Net NPA of SCBs declining to `1.01 lakh\ncrore (decadal low of 0.57%) in Sep-24\nfrom `2.31 lakh crore (3.13%) in Mar-15\nand from a peak of `5.2 lakh crore (5.94%)\nin Mar-18.\n` lakh crore\n\uf0b7 Net NPA of PSBs declining to `0.63 lakh\ncrore (0.63%) in Sep-24 from `2.15 lakh\ncrore (3.92%) in Mar-15 and from a peak\nof `4.54 lakh crore (7.97%) in Mar-18.\nMar-18Mar-15 Sept-24\nMar-18Mar-15 Sept-24Department of Financial Services V\n233\n(ii) Resilience has increased with-\n\uf0b7 Provision coverage ratio (PCR) of SCBs\nincreasing from 49.31% in Mar-15 to a\nhealthy 92.88% in Sep-24.\no PCR of PSBs increasing from 46.04% in\nMar-15 to a healthy 93.82% in Sep-24.\n(iii) Capital adequacy has improved\nsignificantly with-\n\uf0b7 CRAR of SCBs improving by 383 bps to\nreach 16.77% in Sep-24 from 12.94% in\nMar-15.\no CRAR of PSBs improving by 393 bps to\nreach 15.38% in Sep-24 from 11.45% in\nMar-15.\n(iv) Highest ever aggregate net profit\nDuring FY24, SCBs have recorded\nhighest ever aggregate net profit of  `3.50\nlakh crore against net profit of  `2.63 lakh\ncrore in FY23, and recorded aggregate\nnet profit of `1.99 lakh crore in the first\nhalf of FY25. In FY24, PSBs have\nrecorded highest ever aggregate net profit\nof `1.41 lakh crore against net profit of\n`1.05 lakh crore in FY23, and recorded\n`0.86 lakh crore in the first half of FY25.\n(b) Dividend\nPSBs declared dividend of `27,830 crore\nto shareholders (GoI share `18,013 crore)\nin FY24 against total dividend of `20,964\ncrore to shareholders (GoI share `13,804)\nin FY23.\n(c) Market raising of capital\nEnabled by implementation of comprehensive reforms, the financial health of PSBs has improved significantly,\nenhancing their ability to raise capital (in the form of both equity and bonds) from the market. PSBs have\nmobilised capital of `4.72 lakh crore from the market from FY15 to FY25 (up to 31.12.2024).\nAnnual Report 2024-2025\n234\n(d) Prompt Corrective Action\nBanks, earlier placed under Prompt\nCorrective Action (PCA) framework by\nRBI, have made significant improvement\nresulting in removal of each one of them\nfrom the PCA restrictions.\n(e) NARCL\nAs on 14.1.2025, NARCL has acquired\n24 borrower entities, with an aggregate\ndebt exposure of `105,008 crores.

NARCL\nhas given offers in 2 accounts (Debt\nExposure of `49,999 crore) where swiss\nchallenge is underway.\n` crore\n4.2. Important decisions / Initiatives taken\na) Review of guidelines on the number of posts of\nChief General managers (CGMs) / General\nManagers (GMs) / Deputy General Managers\n(DGM)s / Assistant General Managers (AGMs)\nStatus as on last year:  With a view to make the\nspan of control more manageable and effective,\nGovernment in the year 2019 had conveyed 'no\nobjection' to introduce Chief General Manager (CGM)\npost, below board level, in those Nationalised Banks\n(NBs) having a total business of Rs. 10 Lakh crore or\nhigher. Accordingly, CGM post was available in six\nout of eleven Nationalized Banks. The remaining banks\nhave been approaching the Government for making\navailable the CGM post in their banks also. There was\nalso a demand from all the NBs to review existing\nmethodology for fixing the number of executives citing\nvarious reasons such as high pace of digitalization,\nthe growing role of specialized and dedicated verticals,\nbranch expansion etc. The number of executives from\nthe post of AGM to CGM, were 5800 across all\nnationalised banks.\nPresent Status: The Finance Minister, in the year\n2024, has approved the creation of CGM post in\nremaining five nationalized banks (i.e.) Bank of\nMaharashtra, Central Bank of India, Indian Overseas\nBank, Punjab & Sind Bank and UCO Bank. While\ncreating the said post, the Finance Minister has also\napproved the increase in the existing number of CGMs\nin the banks that already have CGM level posts. This\nstep will significantly enhance the administrative\nstructure and efficiency of banks.\nCGM post acts as an administrative and functional\nlayer between the General Manager (GM) and the\nExecutive Director (board level post) in the\nNationalized Banks. The increase of CGM posts will\nenhance the capability of banks to better monitor\ncritical positions such as digitalisation, cyber security,\nfin-tech, risk, compliance, rural banking, financial\ninclusion etc., and sub-domains like retail Credit, Agri-\ncredit, MSME Credit etc., thereby leading to more\ntargeted strategies and improved overall performance.\nIncrease in the number of CGMs will further enable\nthe banks to have a better control and supervision\nthereby resulting in improved asset management and\noperational efficiency.\nThe number of posts has been revised based on\nthe business mix of the banks as on 31.03.2023, with\nthe ratio of one CGM for every four GMs. This creation\n/ increase will not only benefit the GMs elevating to\nthe post of CGM but also benefit the immediate lower\nlevels of executives, below GM level posts i.e. Deputy\nGeneral Managers (DGM) and Assistant General\nManagers (AGM), as with the increase of 01 CGM\nlevel post, there will be an increase in 04 GM posts,\n12 DGM posts and 36 AGM posts.\nWith the revision, the number of CGM posts in all\nthe 11 Nationalised Banks has been increased from\n80 to 144. Accordingly, the number of GM posts has\nbeen revised from 440 to 576, the number of DGM\nposts from 1320 to 1728 and the number of AGM postsDepartment of Financial Services V\n235\nfrom 3960 to 5184. Post enhancement at the senior management level will lead to increased oversight and will\nresult in better identification and mitigation of risks, especially in complex financial environments.\nThis significant step has been taken keeping in\nview the demands being received from various banks\nand also due to the substantial growth in business,\nverticals, domains and branch expansions of the banks\nthat require a dedicated pyramid of executives at the\nsenior level\nb) Revision in the ceiling on the Staff Welfare Fund\nin Public Sector Banks (PSBs) - Staff welfare fund\n(SWF) is a fund allocated by the PSBs for the welfare-\nrelated activities (health-related expenses, subsidies\non canteen, sports and cultural activities, education-\nrelated financial assistance etc.) in respect of working\nand retired officials of PSBs. SWF was given a fillip\nby increasing the maximum ceiling of annual spending.\nStatus as on last year: PSB were using the SWF ceiling\nas per the revision made in year 2012. Post amalgamation\nin 2019/2020, PSBs were using combined ceiling of\namalgamated banks. The combined maximum annual\nexpenditure ceiling of SWF for all PSBs was Rs 540 Crore.\nThe ceiling on SWF was ranging earlier from Rs. 15 Cr to\n150 Cr. among PSBs.\nPresent Status: The ceiling on SWF has been thoroughly\nrevised in the year 2024, after taking into consideration\nthe number of employees and retirees in PSBs as of 2024\nand the change in the business mix of the PSBs. PSBs\nwere categorized into four different slabs based on their\nbusiness mix and the employee strength and the combined\nmaximum annual expenditure ceiling of SWF for all the\n12 PSBs has increased from Rs.540 crore to Rs.845 crore.\nThis increase will benefit 15 lakh staff including the retired\nemployees of all the 12 PSBs. A graphical presentation in\nthis regard is as under:\nAnnual Report 2024-2025\n236\nThis measure reflects the Government's commitment to support the welfare of both current employees and retirees\nof PSBs, recognising the rising cost of welfare services and the expanded workforce following recent mergers.\nThese welfare initiatives shall boost the workforce morale and help create a supportive environment, essential for\ncontinued growth in India's banking sector.\nc) Revision of Crisis Management Plan (CMP) - The\nCMP, first formulated in the year 2019 and modified\nsubsequently in the year 2021, is invoked for an\nindustry-wide strike in Banking Industry for three or\nmore days. It involves proactive preparation,\ncommunication, and coordination to minimize\ndisruption, ensure stakeholder safety and restore\noperations swiftly. Based on the observation of the\nSecretary (Security), Cabinet Secretariat and the\nsuggestions of the stakeholders, the CMP has been\nrevisited and revised CMP-2024 has been circulated\nto all PSBs to make their Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOP) in line with CMP-2024 of this\nDepartment.\nHighlights on new inclusions in CMP-2024 : The\nhighlights of the modifications done in the CMP - 2024\nare as under:\ni.

Mitigating the Crisis by ensuring full functioning\nof Critical Infrastructure like Currency Chests,\nCheque Clearing Processing Centres (CCPCs),\nData Centres, Data Recovery Centres, Treasury\nOperations etc.\nThe CMP 2024 provides a comprehensive framework\nfor handling potential industry-wide strikes in the\nbanking sector, ensuring minimal disruption to\nservices. It establishes Crisis Management Teams at\nmultiple level and a coordination framework among\nthem, enabling banks to prepare for strike situation,\nmitigate operational vulnerability during strikes and\nsustain core operations including critical infrastructure\nlike ATMs and data centres.Department of Financial Services V\n237\nThe CMP ensures that customers are also informed\nabout strike timelines and have access to essential\nservices through alternative channels such as mobile\n& internet banking. This comprehensive approach\nhelps maintain trust, enabling banks to uphold stability\nand protect customer interests during potential crises.\nd) Performance Linked Incentive Scheme for\nWhole-time Directors and senior executives in\nPSBs:\nStatus as per last year:\nEarlier Performance Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme\nwas introduced to suitably reward and motivate Whole-\nTime Directors (WTDs) of Public Sector Banks (PSBs)\nonly. The eligibility for PLIs for the WTDs of the PSBs\nwas evaluated on the basis of Key Performance\nIndicators (KPI) approved by the Finance Minister. The\nmaximum amount of PLI payable to Managing Director\n& Chief Executive Officer was Rs. 8 Lakh and to\nExecutive Director was Rs. 6.5 Lakh. This Scheme\nwas not applicable to other officers of the banks.\nThe increasing presence, dominance and swift ability\nto embrace system-driven changes by other players\nin the market like Private Sector Banks, Foreign\nBanks, Payment Banks, Small Finance Banks and\nother financial sector participants such as Non-\nBanking Financial Institutions (NBFCs) and other FIs\nhave changed the scope of banking in multitudes and\nare forcing the PSBs to evolve beyond traditional\nbanking. These changes are required to be aptly\nrecognized and accordingly the compensation\npackage, scheme coverage and KPIs with its evaluation\nmatrix are required to be revised to reflect present\nmarket position.\nCurrent Status:\nAccordingly, Finance Minister has approved a revised\nScheme for Performance Linked Incentive with the\nobjective to suitably reward and motivate WTDs of\nPSBs. Further, for greater inclusivity, the revised PLI\nScheme has been made applicable to senior\nexecutives from Scale-IV to Scale - VIII (i.e. Chief\nManager to Chief General Manager) duly recognising\nthe leadership role played by them in efficient steering\nof the bank's performance.\nThe revised PLI Scheme shall evaluate performance\non detailed Evaluation Matrix comprising of four equally\nweighted Evaluation Parameters - (i) Efficiency, (ii)\nBusiness, (iii) Asset Quality and (iv) Financial Inclusion\n(including EASE reforms). The first three parameters\nare further divided into 12 sub-parameters. The\nperformance evaluation on these sub-parameters shall\nbe made using different Evaluation Methodologies such\nas comparing performance with previous year's\nperformance of the bank, comparing performance with\naverage performance of Scheduled Commercial Bank\nand Public Sector Banks and performance in respect\nof allocated targets. Further, under parameter (iv),\nperformance of all the PSBs are assessed on the basis\nof achievement of targets for flagship schemes for\nfinancial inclusion.\nUnder the revised PLI Scheme, the maximum amount\nof incentive for WTDs has been increased to their\nannual basic pay. Similar provision, with suitable\nmodification, has been made for senior executives in\nthe scale-IV to scale - VIII. The revised Scheme will\nfoster a sense of accomplishment, encourage\ncontinuous learning and innovation and promote\ncompetitive atmospheres that will boost the\nproductivity. The Scheme is effective from FY 2023-\n24.\n4.3. Regional Rural Banks\nThe Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) were established\nunder the RRBs Act, 1976 to create an alternative\nchannel for credit dispensation to small and marginal\nfarmers, agricultural laborers, socio-economically\nweaker section of population for development of\nagriculture, trade, commerce, small scale industry and\nother productive activities in rural areas. As on 31\nMarch 2024, 43 RRBs are operating through a network\nof 22,069 branches in 26 States and 3 Union T erritories\n(Puducherry, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh) covering 700\ndistricts of the country. The RRBs are jointly owned\nby the Central Government, the concerned State\nGovernment and the Sponsor Banks with shareholding\nin the ratio of 50:15:35 respectively.Annual Report 202\u0017-2025\n238\nAnnual Report 2024 -2 025\n4.3.1. Role of RRBs:\nRRBs have a mandate to ensure rural development\nand foster financial inclusion. The contributions being\nmade by RRBs as a whole at present, are briefly as\nunder:\n(i) Of the total loans extended by RRBs, as on 31st\nMarch 2024, over 87% of loans are extended to\nthe priority sector, and about 67% is towards\nagriculture sector. Of the total loans, about 61%\nof are extended to weaker sections of the society.\n(ii) RRBs play a significant role in extending micro\ncredit. They account for 31% of the SHG loan\naccounts and 25% of the total loan amount is\nextended to SHGs. Nearly 19% of the total KCCs\nhave been issued by the RRBs.\n(iii) Share of RRBs in total accounts/enrollments under\nGovernment Sponsored Schemes like PMJDY,\nPMJJBY, PMSBY, APY, etc. varies from 15% to\n20%.\n(iv) 92% of the branches of RRBs are in rural and\nsemi urban areas. RRBs have a share of 29% in\nthe number of rural bank branches. In the rural\nareas of aspirational districts, RRBs have about\n40% of the bank branches. Moreover, many RRBs\nhave branches in remote areas and they are\nproviding financial services to vulnerable sections.\n(v) In rural areas, the share of deposit accounts of\nRRBs is about 25% and RRBs have the highest\naverage balance in PMJDY accounts amongst all\ncategories of banks. In North-eastern region,\nRRBs cater to the banking needs of about 38%\nof the rural people. As against the overall rural CD\nRatio of 70% for all the Scheduled Commercial\nBanks, RRBs had a rural CD Ratio of 79% as on\n31 March 2024. As a result of a healthy credit\ngrowth of RRBs during the previous 3 years, the\nconsolidated CD ratio of RRBs improved to 71.4\n% as on 31 March 2024, which was the highest\nCD Ratio in over 33 years.\n4.3.2. Recapitalization Scheme:\nThe Government of India along with other stakeholders\nof RRBs viz concerned state government and sponsor\nbanks recapitalise them to help RRBs meet the\nregulatory requirement of 9% CRAR (Capital to Risk\nWeighted Assets Ratio). Infusion of capital in RRBs\nis done with an aim to rejuvenate and revitalise the\nRRBs with sufficient growth capital to facilitate\nreinventing themselves as sustainably viable and self-\nsufficient financial institutions and for leading the\ngrowth process and the change in rural areas. The\ncapital infusion is to help RRBs in technology\nadoption and to efficiently cater to the financial\ninclusion needs of the rural populace.\nFurther, the recapitalisation scheme is accompanied\nby operational and governance reforms under the broad\nDepartment of Financial Services V\n239\nambit of Sustainable Viability Plan (SVP) with a well-\ndefined implementation mechanism aimed at credit\nexpansion, business diversification, NPA reduction,\ncost rationalisation, technology adoption,\nimprovement in corporate governance etc.\n4.3.3. Progress & Outcome:\ni) The last recapitalization support was provided to RRBs\nas a one-time upfront recapitalisation of Rs.5,445 crore\nas GoI share, approved by Expenditure Finance\nCommittee (EFC) in its meeting held on 11.10.2021,\n75% of which i.e. Rs.4,084 crore was infused into the\nRRBs during the FY 2021-22. The balance 25% of\nrecapitalisation support of Rs.1,361 crore as GoI share\nwas to be infused during the year 2022-23, upon\ndemonstrable improvement in the operational and\ngovernance reforms as per the Viability Plan.\nii) Accordingly, each RRB prepared a 3-year Board\napproved Viability Plan in FY 2022-23 encompassing\noperational and governance reforms. The RRBs\ndemonstrated a significant improvement in key\nfinancial indicators under the viability plan. Therefore,\nthe balance amount of Rs.1,361 crore was infused\ninto the RRBs during the FY 2023-24 and 2024-25.\niii) In this backdrop, the performance of RRBs has\nimproved significantly during FY 2023-24 and has\nreached historic highs on several parameters. RRBs\nposted highest ever consolidated net profit of `7,571\ncrore during FY 2023-24 and their consolidated CRAR\nwas at an all-time high of 14.2% as on 31 March 2024.\nThe asset quality measured by GNPA (Gross Non-\nPerforming Assets) at 6.1% was the lowest in previous\n10 years. Credit expansion led to an increase in\nconsolidated CD ratio to 71.4%, which was the highest\nin over 33 years. The pace of technology adoption\nhas increased as more RRBs have started rolling out\ndigital services to their customers.\nConsolidated Net Profit of 43 RRBs\n4.3.4. Important Developments in the context of RRBs in FY 2024-25:\n4.3.4(i). Review meetings of RRBs by Hon'ble Union Finance Minister:\nHon'ble Union Finance Minister chaired meetings in different regions of the country to review the functioning of RRBs.\nThe details of the review meetings held during 2024-25 are as follows:\nSr. \nNo. Region Place Date of Review \n1 National Level Review of all RRBs New Delhi 19 August 2024 \n2 Western & Central Region Udaipur, Rajasthan 22 August 2024 \n3 Northeastern Region Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh 30 September 2024 \n4 Southern Region Bengaluru, Karnataka 09 November 2024 \n5 Eastern Region Patna, Bihar 29 November 2024 \n Annual Report 2024-2025\n240\n4.3.4(ii). Initiation of process for Phase-IV\nAmalgamation of RRBs:\nIn terms of section 23A of RRBs Act, 1976, Central\nGovernment, after consultation with NABARD, the\nconcerned State Government and the Sponsor Bank\nmay amalgamate, in public interest, two or more RRBs\nin a State.\nWith a view to enable RRBs to minimize their overhead\nexpenses, optimize the use of technology, enhance\nthe capital base and area of operation and increase\ntheir exposure, Government of India (GoI) initiated\nstructural consolidation of RRBs in FY 2004-05, which\nhas resulted in reduction in the number of RRBs from\n196 to 43 till FY 2020-21 through 3 phases of\namalgamation.\nIn order to retain the USP of RRBs viz. the closeness\nto rural communities, and derive the benefits of scale\nefficiency and cost rationalisation, GoI has decided\nto embark on further consolidation of RRBs towards\nthe goal of 'One State-One RRB'.\n4.3.4(iii) Performance of RRBs under Financial security schemes\nThe comparative performance of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) versus all banks under financial inclusion schemes\nis provided below.

An additional interest subvention of 3% is provided\nto farmers on prompt repayment of loans, which effectively\nreduces the rate of interest to 4%.\nTo enable universal access to Concessional\nInstitutional credit, Government of India has initiated a drive\nin Mission Mode from February 2020 for saturating all PM-\nKISAN beneficiaries with Kisan Credit Card (KCC). This\nwill help all such farmers to get short term loan for crop &\nanimal/fish rearing at a maximum interest of 4% on timely\nrepayment. Over 5.57 crore farmers have been covered\nunder the ongoing KCC saturation drive effective from\nFebruary, 2020 with sanctioned credit limit of about\nRs.7.12 lakh crore as on 22.11.2024. At present (as on\n30.09.2024), there are 7.72 crore operative KCC accounts\nwith a total outstanding loan of Rs.9.99 lakh crore.\n While ensuring convenient and cost-effective credit\ndelivery to farmers, the ongoing campaign will be\ninstrumental in driving the rural economy and further\naccelerating agricultural production and allied activities,\nbesides enhancing the income level of farmers.\nThe facility of KCC has also been extended to animal\nhusbandry and fisheries farmers in year 2019 to help them\nmeet their working capital needs. Further, in order to cover\nanimal husbandry and fisheries farmers, under KCC,\nspecial saturation drive in the form of weekly \"District level\nCamp\" was launched w.e.f. 15 th November, 2021 for\nensuring convenient and cost-effective credit delivery to\nthe farmers and accelerating agriculture output.\nThe Nationwide AHDF KCC Campaign was extended\nfrom time to time up to 31 st March 2024.

Priority Sector Lending\nThe objective of priority sector lending (PSL) is to\nensure that vulnerable sections of society get access to\ncredit and for maintaining adequate flow of resources to\nthose segments of the economy which have higher\nemployment potential and also help in making an impact\non poverty alleviation. Thus, the sectors that impact large\nsections of the population, the weaker sections and the\nsectors which are employment-intensive such as\nagriculture and micro and small enterprises are part of\nthe priority sector\n(i) With this background, RBI has framed the Priority\nSector Lending (PSL) guidelines to facilitate the flow\nof credit to these segments from banking system.\n(ii) As per the existing guidelines, priority sector loans\ninclude loans to eight eligible categories- Agriculture,\nMicro, Small and Medium enterprises, Export Credit,\nEducation, Housing, Social Infrastructure, Renewable\nEnergy and Others.\n(iii) Further, the guidelines also specify targets of 40% for\nlending to PSL by Scheduled commercial Banks\n(SCBs) and targets of 75 % for lending to PSL by\nRegional Rural Banks (RRBs) and Urban Cooperative\nbank (UCBs). UCBs will achieve this target in phased\nmanner by 2025-26. Within overall PSL, following sub-\ntargets have been assigned to banks as percent to\nAdjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent\nof Off-Balance sheet Exposures (CEOBE), whichever\nis higher.\nSub-targets:\nAgriculture 18%; out of which a target of\n10% is prescribed for Small\nand Marginal Farmers (SMFs)\nMicro Enterprises 7.5 %\nAdvances to Weaker 12 % for SCBs & 15% for RRBs\nSections\n(iv) The performance of Scheduled Commercial Banks\n(SCBs) and Regional Rural banks (RRBs) in\nachievement of priority sector lending targets in the\nlast three years is given as follows:\n(`crore)\nFinancial Year Public Sector \nBanks \nPrivate Sector \nBanks \nForeign \nBanks \nRegional Rural \nBanks# \n2020-21 24,16,750 \n(41.06) \n14,33,674 \n(40.62) \n1,99,969 \n(41.02) \n2,38,636 \n(98.61) \n2021-22 26,49,180 \n(42.90) \n16,85,806 \n(43.71) \n2,08,107 \n(42.65) \n2,45,481 \n(89.76) \n2022-23 30,36,062 \n(44.51) \n21,01,827 \n(44.63) \n2,19,622 \n(42.63) \n2,69,835 \n(95.72) \n2023-24 34,01,407 \n(42.78) \n26,09,386 \n(48.20) \n2,78,694 \n(46.08) \n2,89,336 \n(89.86) \n2024-25 (As on \nSept. 30, 2024) \n35,24,241 \n(42.77) \n27,33,204 \n(45.08) \n2,60,090 \n(42.11) \n2,87,097 \n(84.14) \n Note: Figures in parentheses are percentage to ANBC or credit equivalent of off-balance sheet exposure (CEOBE),\nwhichever is higher.

Education Loans upto `20\nlakh are also considered as eligible for priority sector\nlending.\n(viii) To address regional disparities, districts will be ranked\nbased on per capita priority sector credit flow, with\nincentives for areas with lower credit flow and\ndisincentives for those with higher flow. From FY 2024-\n25, districts with lower per capita PSL (less than\n`9,000) will receive a higher weight (125%) for\nincremental credit, while those with higher per capita\nPSL (greater than `42,000) will have a lower weight\n(90%).\n(ix) To ensure continuous flow of credit to priority sector,\nthe compliance of banks is being monitored by RBI\non 'quarterly' basis.
